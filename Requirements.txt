Coding Test
Develop code to implement the following requirements.
Basic Bank system requirements:
A user can have as many accounts as they want.
A user can create and delete accounts.
A user can deposit and withdraw from accounts.
An account cannot have less than $100 at any time in an account.
A user cannot withdraw more than 90% of their total balance from an account in a single transaction.
A user cannot deposit more than $10,000 in a single transaction.

Full Stack Roles
Develop an HTTP based API to fulfill the requirements.
A real database is not required and can be faked with in-memory data structures.
Develop a front-end UI to call the API and give feedback to the user if business rules are violated.

Front end only roles
You can build all the requirements directly into a front-end application.
The UI should give the user feedback if business rules are violated.

All Roles
